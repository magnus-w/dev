# This is my first Codespaces note

> I wonder if you understand the significance of this? 


## Check out Codespaces!

Imagine that you have total access to Visual Code Studio in your browser. And what you work on is stuff in your repositories. This is huge!


## You can also compute

But it doesn't stop there. You can also *run* the code! Like in AWS, you can spin up virtual servers and instances of your code and test it, run it. This is huge! On GitHub! It's GitHuge!

The big difference obviously being that if you compare with AWS or GCC, you have to set up your own, local dev environment and upload to the cloud.
